# Get Username and Password

The database passwords required by Websoft9 applications and the default accounts of some applications have been preset in advance and stored in the server where the applications are running.

  You use the **SSH** to connect your Server and run the command `sudo cat /credentials/password.txt` to get the username and password of this deployment solution.
