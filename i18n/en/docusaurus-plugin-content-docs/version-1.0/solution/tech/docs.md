# Docs and knowledge base

Enterprise CEOs attach great importance to knowledge accumulation and sharing, but in the actual operation process, they find the following common problems:

* Insufficient knowledge extraction ability of front-line employees
* Knowledge lags and inaccurate when collaborating across departments
* Everyone has a copy, and it is impossible to centrally iterate knowledge
* There is a lot of duplication between the internal knowledge base and the external knowledge base

The above problems are also encountered in Websoft9's operation. Fortunately, we have adopted different knowledge base platforms to finally allow the enterprise's knowledge to be well precipitated and accumulated.
