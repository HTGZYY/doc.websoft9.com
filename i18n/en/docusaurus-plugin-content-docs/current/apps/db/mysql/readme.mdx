# MySQL/MariaDB Getting Started

[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/products/community/) is a popular open source database. Whether you are a fast growing web property, technology ISV or large enterprise, MySQL can cost-effectively help you deliver high performance, scalable database applications. It is intend to provide a high reliable database management system. MariaDB is one of the most popular database servers. Made by the original developers of MySQL. Guaranteed to stay open source.

[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) is one of the most popular database servers in the world. It’s made by the original developers of MySQL and guaranteed to stay open source. Notable users include Wikipedia, WordPress.com and Google. MariaDB is developed as open source software and as a relational database it provides an SQL interface for accessing data. The latest versions of MariaDB also include GIS and JSON features.

If you have installed Websoft9 MySQL/MariaDB, the following steps is for your quick start

## Preparation

1. Get the **Internet IP** of your Server on Cloud
2. Check your **[Inbound of Security Group Rule](./administrator/firewall#security)** of Cloud Console to ensure the **TCP:3306,9090** is allowed
3. Complete **[Five steps for Domain](./administrator/domain_step)** if you want to use Domain for Jenkins
4. [Get](./user/credentials) default username and password of Jenkins

## MySQL/MariaDB Initialization

### Steps for you

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="linuxwizard" label="Linux" default>

1. Use the **SSH** to connect Server, and run these command below to view the installation information and running status
   ```
   sudo systemctl status mysqld
   #### or ####
   sudo systemctl status mysql
   ```

2. You can ge the message from SSH " Active: active (running)... " when MySQL is running

3. Using SSH to connect MySQL Server, run the following command
   ~~~
   #assume the root password is `123456`
   mysql -uroot –p123456
   ~~~

4. You can find the MySQL version from the message
   ![](http://libs.websoft9.com/Websoft9/DocsPicture/en/mysql/mysql01.png)

5. Login MySQL with [phpMyAdmin](#phpmyadmin)
   

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="winwizard" label="Windows">

1.  Remote to Windows Server, run the following command with Windows-CMD Window
   ~~~
   #assume the root password is `123456`
   mysql -uroot –p123456
   ~~~
2. Using Navicat on the Server Desktop

### Having trouble?

Below is for you to solve problem, and you can contact **[Websoft9 Support](./helpdesk)** or refer to **[Troubleshoot + FAQ](./faq#setup)** to get more.  


## MySQL/MariaDB QuickStart

## MySQL/MariaDB Setup

### Modify and reset MySQL password

Modify password: Change the current password to another password  
Reset password: Have forgotten your password, need to get an initial password

**Modify password**

You can modify password by MySQL GUI or commands:

1. Use phpMyAdmin(Recommend)

![](http://libs.websoft9.com/Websoft9/DocsPicture/zh/mysql/websoft9-modifymysqlpw.gif)

2. Use Commands
```
mysqladmin -u root -p oldpassword password 'newpassword' 
```

**Reset password**

You can reset your MySQL password by the following two solution:  

1. Use SSH to connect MySQL Server
2. Run the following command
   ```
   wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/websoft9dev/role_mysql/master/tools/reset_password.sh; bash reset_password.sh
   ```


### Set Remote Connection{#remote}

Most of the time, if you want to use GUI tools to manage MySQL/MariaDB on you local computer, you shoud open the remote connection of MySQL/MariaDB. 

Database is high security application, you need two steps for remote connection settings at least:

1. Enable the TCP:3306 port
   
2. Open MySQL remote connection
   
    * [phpMyAdmin Quick set (recommended）](#phpmyadminremote)
    * Use commands
     ```
     # Log in MySQL
     mysql -u root -p 
     
     # Enable Remote
     mysql>  use mysql;
     mysql>  update user set host = '%' where user = 'root';
    
     # Restart MySQL
     systemctl restart mysqld

     ```

### Modify MySQL Data Directory{#datadirectory}

The data directory for MySQL is set to */data/mysql* by default. If you want to modify MySQL Data Directory, following are the steps for you:

1. Stop the MySQL Service
   ```shell
   sudo sytemctl stop mysqld
   ```
2. Move the */data/mysql* to the destination directory, e.g */data/mysql2* 
3. Modify the location of this folder modifying the`/etc/my.cnf` file, as shown below:
   ```shell
   datadir=/data/mysql2
   ```
4. Restart the MySQL
   ```shell
   sudo sytemctl start mysqld
   ```

### Set The Binary Log

You can modify the MySQL configuration _/etc/my.cnf_ to change the binary log settings<br />

```
log_bin = mysql-bin      # enable Binary log
binlog_format = mixed    # Binary log format
expire_logs_days = 7     # Binary log expire time
```

Some times, there a lot of event for your database, then the binary log file size very rapid growth and your disk space may not enough, if there no space on disk, your MySQL Service can not start.

Suggest you change the expire_logs_day to more smaller if you binary log file size is too big

### GUI

Working on a relational database using only command line tools to writing queries can be hard, luckily we found the best Free GUI tools for your MySQL work. Most uses of MySQL for Web development allow you to get around a lot of back end requirements with the use of PHP and other tools that work the database without having to do more than set up. However, as the use of SQL for Web development has increased, and the complexities, so has the availability of tools to manage your SQL database. Here are some of the best tools for working with your MySQL database.

phpMyAdmin supports multiple MySQL instances.

Modify the corresponding environment variable of the docker-compose file of phpMyAdmin (PMA_HOST is changed to PMA_HOSTS) to support:
```
version: "3.7"
services:
  phpmyadmin:
      image: phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin
      container_name: "phpmyadmin"
      environment:
       - PMA_HOSTS=172.17.0.1,172.17.0.2
       - PMA_PORTS=3306
       - UPLOAD_LIMIT=20M 
...
```

#### Modify import file size limit

The default file size that phpMyAdmin can import is limited, you can modify it by the following steps:

1. Use SFTP to connect to the server, edit the */data/apps/phpmyadmin/docker-compose.yml* file, and add a field to the environment variable `- UPLOAD_LIMIT=20M`
  ```
  version: "3.7"
  services: 
    phpmyadmin:
