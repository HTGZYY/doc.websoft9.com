#### Installing multiple Duplicati exceptions?

Description: Installing multiple Duplicati exceptions  
Reason: Duplicati is bind to the host's **Fixed Path** by default, so when installing a second Duplicati, it will use the same path, and therefore attempts permissions issues.     
Solution: It is not recommended to install more than one Duplicati.
