3. The first time Scratch loads more than 20M of data, if your network bandwidth is inadequate, the loading process will be extremely slow. Please wait patiently!

## Troubleshooting{#troubleshooting}

#### Not loading or very slow to access? {#slowy}

The first time Scratch loads data over 20M. e.g. if you are using 2M bandwidth, then ideally the loading time would be: 20000k/(128k/s x 2) = 78s. Obviously if the bandwidth is insufficient, it will be very slow.  

Additionally, Scratch loads Google Stats resources, which can also lead to anomalous or slower access.  

#### Background and character icons not loading? {#assets}

Reason: Scratch pre-made character icons and background images are stored in the official server, and there are network limitations when getting them online.  

Solution: [Download](https://libs.websoft9.com/apps/scratch/asset.zip) to your local computer and use it by **uploading**.
