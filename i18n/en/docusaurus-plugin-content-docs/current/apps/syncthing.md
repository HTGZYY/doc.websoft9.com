### Server synchronization

Syncthing is mainly used to synchronize files or folders between multiple servers. The following describes the specific operation (assuming Server A, Server B):

1. Make sure Syncthing is installed on both servers.

2. Login to Syncthing on Server A, add a remote device, then the device ID of Server B will be found automatically, check it.

3. Login to Syncthing on Server B, then accept the connection request from Server A. Click **+Add Remote Device** and follow the guide to complete the connection.

4. Click **+Add Folder** in the Syncthing console of both servers.

   - General > Folder ID (A and B use the same ID)
   - General > Folder Path
   - Shared (check)

5. All settings are complete, and synchronization will now occur automatically.
