## Getting started{#guide}

### Log in to the backend {#wizard}

After installing Graylog in the **Websoft9 console**, view the application details through **My Applications** and get the login information in the **Access** tab.

## Enterprise Edition

Websoft9 is a Graylog Enterprise Edition partner. Pricing factors for Graylog Enterprise Edition include:  

* Log Storage: Graylog Enterprise Edition is priced primarily on log storage.
* Clustering: Graylog cluster deployment is also a pricing reference.
* ES: Clustering is supported in the open source version of Elasticsearch, but for more functionality, a subscription to the commercial version of Elasticsearch is required.

## Configuration options{#configs}

- SMTP (âœ…): implemented by the **transport_email** parameter of the configuration file
- Configuration file: configuration options can all be prefixed with upper case GRAYLOG_ Implementation of container environment variableization
    ```
    GRAYLOG_TRANSPORT_EMAIL_ENABLED: "true"
    GRAYLOG_TRANSPORT_EMAIL_HOSTNAME: smtp
    GRAYLOG_TRANSPORT_EMAIL_PORT: 25
    GRAYLOG_TRANSPORT_EMAIL_USE_AUTH: "false"
    GRAYLOG_TRANSPORT_EMAIL_USE_TLS: "false"
    GRAYLOG_TRANSPORT_EMAIL_USE_SSL: "false"
    ```

## Troubleshooting{#troubleshooting}

#### Alerts and errors after login ?

Description: Prompt There is a node without any running inputs. this means ... ?
![](./assets/graylog-nofiinput-websoft9.png)

Reason: This is just a reminder that there is currently no input, not an error.

Solution: Create a new local input to get rid of this reminder!

Description: Index rotation strategy null not found...? 

Reason: This problem occurs when the free disk space is less than 15%.

Solution: Free up redundant files or increase server disk space.

#### Does Graylog store data?

It does not store, it relies on Elasticsearch to store the data.

Elasticsearch architecture:

* Elasticsearch is used to store logs and search for logs, clustering improves efficiency
* Graylog is used to transfer data and present data, clustering improves availability
* MongoDB is used to store configuration information, very little data, and clustering is limited.
