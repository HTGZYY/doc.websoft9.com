## Getting started{#guide}

### Initial setup{#wizard}

1. When completed installation of screego at **Websoft9 Console**, get the applicaiton's **Overview** and **Access** information from **My Apps**  

2. Login to the Websoft9 console and set up HTTPS access for the screego application.

   > The domain name must be configured during installation for screego to work.

3. Use an external TURN server to start the port as appropriate (optional)


### Use it now

1. Go to the main screen of screego and click on **CREATE OR JOIN A ROOM** to create a room.

2. Send the URL of the new room to the other clients that need to share the screen.

3. Other clients open the URL and start using it.


## Configuration options{#configs}

- Used by more than two people(âœ…)
- STUN/TURN relay server (built-in): the client (browser) first tries **direct connection**. If direct connection is not possible, the STUN server is used for **penetration**, and if penetration is not possible, the TURN server is used for **relay**.
