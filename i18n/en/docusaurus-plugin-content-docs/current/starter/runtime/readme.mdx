# Deploy from App Runtime

Websoft9 **App Runtime** enables you to build and host web apps, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice. It enables automated deployments from GitHub, or any Git repo. It provides a programming language template such as Java, Python, Node.js, PHP, Go, Ruby, and .NET, as well as Docker image and static website deployment.

## Learn about App Runtime

Understand App Runtime types for use cases and basic configuration parameters.

### Use cases

Websoft9 **App Runtime**  includes below types for different use cases: 

| App Runtime template                                           | Use case                   | 
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| PHP, Node.js, Java, Python, Ruby, .NET     | Web application, Web development framework  |
| Apache, Nginx, Caddy           | Static website |
| Docker                                    | Docker application    |
| Hugo, Jekyll, Gatsby, Hexo, Next.js | Static website application      |
| Laravel, Django                    | Web framework application         |

### How it work?

App the **App Runtime** templates have the same deployment methods that based on GitOps and [IaC](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/iac/):  

- After launching the App Runtime, Websoft9 create three resources for user to deploy source code or binary, includes: 

  - Git repository
  - language container
  - server block of Gateway

- Then user can upload install packages and add deployment scripts to language container by updating App Runtime


### Common parameters

These are the common parameters for deployment by App Runtime:  

- **Orchestration tool**: docker compose
- **Container Port**: 8080
- **Dockerfile build**: Not support now
- **Execute commands at container**: Yes
- **Preconfigured deploy scripts**: Container directory `/usr/local/bin/cmd.sh` that mount to `src/cmd.sh` of repository
- **Character encoding**: UTF-8
- **Multiply version**: Yes
- **Root directory path**: Docker exec to container and command `pwd` to get path, and below for your references

  - PHP: */var/www/html*
  - Jetty: */var/lib/jetty/webapps*
  - Tomee: */usr/local/tomee*
  - Tomee: */usr/local/tomcat*
  - Nginx: */usr/share/nginx/html*
  - Caddy: */srv*
  - Apache HTTP Server: */usr/local/apache2/htdocs*
  - Other Runtime: */usr/src/app*

### Language specific

Language specific configurations you may need to know: root directory, package manager, install extensions, compilation, command line, container operating system, and more.

## Deploy application Guide{#guide}

App Runtime is a special application of Websoft9. You just need a few steps to deploy application by App Runtime  

### Prepration

- [Set global domain for Websoft9](./domain-set#wildcard)
- [Plan your install packages](./plan-package)

### Step1: Prepare install packages

Your installation package must to be downloaded for Websoft9 App Runtime, it is better than FTP/SFTP upload: 

- No files permission issues and more secure
- More suitable for automated deployment

If your installation package not have download URL, you can create download URL by [Upload files to git repository](./plan-git#create).  

### Step2: Launch App Runtime 

1. [Login to Websoft9 Console](./login-console), go to the **APP Runtime** catalog of **App Store**
   ![](./assets/runtime-catalog-websoft9.png)

2. Install one of App Runtime at Websoft9 Console

3. When App Runtime is running, three resources created for user to deploy source code or binary, includes: 

   - One Git repository
   - One language runtime container
   - A Nginx proxy block in Websoft9 Gateway, it proxy to language runtime container's **80** port

### Step3: Customize App Runtime{#dockercompose}

You can update the App Runtime deployment by Git repository when it running, major operations includes: 

   - Modify the image tag in the file `docker-compose.yml` to replace the default started container  
   - Add more services or other elements to `docker-compose.yml` file 
   - Add more environments to `.env` file  
   - Modify **W9_VERSION** at file `.env` or other version item at file `docker-compose.yml` for upgrading containers  

You should redeploy App Runtime after customizing any items, then it will take effect.  

If you want to modify environments starting with **W9_**, you need to familiarize with [Websoft9 templates format](https://github.com/Websoft9/docker-library/blob/main/docs/code_owner.md#environments).

### Step4: Deploy packages to App Runtime

Deploying packages is mainly done below steps by commands in the App Runtime container:  

1. **Upload packages**: Download packages to container and extract to the root directory

2. **Build program (optional)**: Compile and build packages

3. **Launch the program**: Run the program's startup command

   - Make sure to run on port 8080 of the container
   - Allow Internet access

Websoft9 offers users two deployment modes to run commands.  

#### Manual interactive deployments

手动进入容器中并逐一执行部署命令时，这种操作一般被称为 “交互式部署” 或 “手动部署”: 

1. [进入容器的命令模式](./inner-container#docker-exec)

2. 在容器中运行上传代码、编译构建等准备工作，具体范例参考: 

   - [PHP](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/php/src/cmd.sh)
   - [Python](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/python/src/cmd.sh)
   - [Ruby](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/ruby/src/cmd.sh)
   - [Go](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/go/src/cmd.sh)
   - [Node.js](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/nodejs/src/cmd.sh)
   - [.NET](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/dotnet/src/cmd.sh)
   - [Java with OpenJDK](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/openjdk/src/cmd.sh)
   - [Java with Tomcat](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/tomcat/src/cmd.sh)
   - [Java with Tomee](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/tomee/src/cmd.sh)
   - [Java with Maven](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/maven/src/cmd.sh)
   - [Java with Jetty](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/jetty/src/cmd.sh)


3. 以 **后台方式启动应用程序** : nohup **Your Command** > output.log 2>&1 &

   - **Your Command** 用实际命令替换，例如: `nohup python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080 > output.log 2>&1 &`
   - nohup 表示以后台运行，> output.log 2>&1 & 是指定日志路径
   - 程序在后台运行后，可以通过 `cat output.log` 查看日志

4. 如果重启容器，需重新执行第 3 步命令

#### Automated scripted deployment{#auto}

Automated script deployment executes tasks without manual intervention.

1. Login to Websoft9 Console, go to the [Compose](./app-compose) tab page of appli manage from **My Apps**
   ![](./assets/runtime-editcompose-websoft9.png)

2. Add your depoyment and startup process to *src/cmd.sh* which includes script sample for you references
  ![](./assets/runtime-composeedit-cmd-websoft9.png)

3. **Redeploy** or **Restart** application, App Runtime container will execute the script for deployment

4. 

  > 自动化脚本部署后重启容器会再次执行 *src/cmd.sh* 中的内容，用户应该保证脚本的健壮性防止重启容器时发生错误。

## Updating your deployment

Updating your deployment refers to the process of making changes to an already deployed application or service. This can involve a variety of tasks, including: 

### Changing version

It only need two steps for changing version for App Runtime: 

1. Get the support version from file `variables.json` at your repository

2. Change the value of W9_VERSION at file `.env` 

3. Reploy the application

### Convert to DevOps workflows 

Websoft App Runtime, based on GitOps, easily transforms program environments into developer-friendly DevOps workflows.  

1. Login to Websoft9 Console, and [Add user](./plan-git#user) at **Websoft9 Git**

2. Grant the new user the authority to manage the Git repository

3. Push your source code to Git repository for development

4. Updating deployment for DevOps

   - Add source code volume at file  `docker-compose.yml`
   - Add build commands at  file `src/cmd.sh`

## Troubleshooting

#### Source of container images?

All container images are officially maintained by Docker or provided by the program's original manufacturer, and are 100% native, with no modifications. 

#### How can I customize deployment?

You can customize deployment by these files at application's repository

- `.env`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `src/cmd.sh`

#### Run multiply apps in one container?

Don't suggest this

#### How to change files permissions?

Execute a command like `chown -R <owner>:<owner> /<path?`

#### How to add startups to container?

You can add your startup commands to container by below methods: 

- Add commands to file `src/cmd.sh`
- Exec to container and running the required process in the background, command like this `nohup  Your CMD here  > output.log 2>&1 &`

#### How can see the process via **nohup**?

Execute a command `jobs`

#### How to delete the running process?

Execute `ps aux` to find the PID, then execute `kill -9 PID`
